# Film Finder

This project was inspired by the lifelong struggle of choosing a movie to watch. With so many options available, you may find yourself mindlessly scrolling through Netflix, never being able to settle on a particular film. Film Finder is a simple command line tool that allows you to randomly generate movie title suggestions, and filter these suggestions based on genre. Using the publically available data provided by IMDB, Film Finder has access to over 600,000 movies, and will always provide you with a mix of fresh suggestions.

# Future changes

- GUI with swing that displays movie suggestions alongside rating, cover art, etc.
- new database tables using further IMDB data to add tv shows, ratings filter
- authentication, allowing a user to have preferences, and a watch history, leading to better suggestions
